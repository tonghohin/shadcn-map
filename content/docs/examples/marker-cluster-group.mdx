## Custom Cluster Icon

You can customize the cluster icon by providing a `icon` prop to the `MapMarkerClusterGroup` component. This prop accepts a function that receives the `markerCount`.

Since you are passing a function as a prop, your component must be a client component by adding `"use client"` at the top of your file.
