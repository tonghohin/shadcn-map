## Controlling Tile Layers

To allow switching between multiple tile layers, wrap several `MapTileLayer` components inside a `MapLayers` container and include the `MapLayersControl` component to provide the UI for switching between them.

If you want to keep the default tile, you can simply include a `<MapTileLayer />` without any props.

## Controlling Layer Groups

To easily show or hide related markers or features on your map, wrap them in `MapLayerGroup` components inside a `MapLayers` container and include the `MapLayersControl` component to provide users with a UI for toggling the visibility of each group.

Use the `defaultLayerGroups` prop to specify which layer groups should be visible by default.
