## Accessing Drawn Shapes

You can pass an optional `onLayersChange` callback to the draw control to get the current layers on the map.
This allows you to handle the drawn shapes, such as saving their coordinates or performing further actions.

## Using Specific Shapes

Simply include only the shape controls you want inside `MapDrawControl`.
