## Accessing Selected Place

You can pass an optional `onPlaceSelect` callback to the search control to receive the place selected by the user from the autocomplete results.

If you need to perform actions on the map after a place is selected (such as panning, zooming, or adding a marker), you must wrap the search control in a **client-side wrapper component** because `useMap` can only be used inside a `Map` container.

In the example below, a client wrapper component listens for place selection, pans the map to the selected location, and renders a marker.

## Accessing Search Results

You can pass an optional `onResultsChange` callback to the search control to receive the search results. You can use this callback to access the results and, for example, display markers on the map for each result.

## Search Configurations

You can configure the search using props supported by [Shadcn Place Autocomplete](https://shadcn-place-autocomplete.vercel.app/), such as limiting the number of results, setting the preferred language, or adjusting other autocomplete behavior.
